@article{Annenkov2019,
abstract = {In this paper, electromagnetic emissions produced by a beam-plasma system are investigated using particle-in-cell simulations for the particular case when the typical transverse size of both the 100 keV electron beam and the produced plasma channel is comparable to the radiation wavelength. The interest in this regime of beam-plasma interaction is associated with highly efficient generation of electromagnetic waves near the plasma frequency harmonics that has been recently observed in laboratory experiments on the GOL-3 mirror trap. It has been found that the radiation power only from the vicinity of the doubled plasma frequency in these experiments can reach 1% of the total beam power. Subsequent theoretical and simulation studies have shown that the most likely candidate for explaining such efficient generation of electromagnetic radiation is the mechanism of a beam-driven plasma antenna based on the conversion of the most unstable plasma oscillations on a longitudinal density modulation of plasma ions. In this paper, we investigate how effectively this mechanism can work in a real experiment at the GOL-3 facility, when a thin subrelativistic electron beam gets a large angular spread due to compression by a magnetic field, and the gas into which it is injected has macroscopic density gradients.},

abstract = {It is found that multi-cycle pulses of high-power coherent terahertz radiation can be efficiently generated in a plasma by counterstreaming long-pulse electron beams driving potential plasma waves via the two-stream instability. Instead of the well-known three-wave interaction processes between oblique beam-driven modes, we propose to generate electromagnetic radiation near the doubled plasma frequency due to the novel and much more efficient mechanism based on the head-on collision of longitudinal plasma waves with mismatching potential profiles. It is shown that this radiation mechanism can be implemented experimentally either by the collision of low-density electron beams with different transverse sizes or by the counter injection of denser equal-size beams unstable against filamentation perturbations. Particle-in-cell simulations for kiloampere electron beams capable of focusing into millimeter-scale sizes demonstrate the possibility to reach the high efficiency of beams-to-THz power conversion (3%–7%...},
